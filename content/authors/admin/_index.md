Hi~ I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies, Yale University](https://isps.yale.edu/), collaborating with Donald Green (Columbia University) and Alan Gerber on political methodology. I received my Ph.D. from [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html). I will be entering the job market for the 2024-25 academic year.

In Methodology, I primarily study *causal mechanisms* and *causal Inference*. My dissertation develops theoretical foundations and statistical methods for identifying and estimating mediation effects in the social sciences. One of the essays, co-authored with Tara Slough, has been awarded the *2024 Gosnell Prize for Excellence in Political Methodology*.

In Formal Theory, my research centers on information and dynamic games. Currently, my project explores the full revelation problem of deliberation and debate. As you might anticipate, I align with two "sects": a proponent of Theoretical Implications of Empirical Models (TIEM) and an advocate for the Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM).

My substantive research spans various topics, including political economy, global health, and epidemiology. In particular, I study bureaucracy and inequality, with a particular focus on *China*. My latest work investigates the implicit influence of the affluent on political responsiveness in authoritarian regimes. Overall, I maintain an open mind towards all compelling research projects!
