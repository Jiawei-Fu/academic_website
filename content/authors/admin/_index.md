Hi~ I am a Ph.D. candidate in Politics at NYU. I am interested in a variety of topics within the social sciences. This year, I am seeking a post-doc position!

In Methodology, I primarily study causal mechanisms and heterogeneous treatment effects. I am currently developing a novel and straightforward identification strategy for causal mediation analysis. The new method can transforms a challenging mediation analysis problem into a simple linear regression problem; it simplifies a complex causality problem into manageable data problem. My method allows researchers simultaneously estimate treatment and mediated effects. 

In Formal Theory, my specific focus centers on information and differential games. At present, my project delves into the full revelation problem of deliberation and debate. As you might anticipate, I fall into both categories: a proponent of Theoretical Implications of Empirical Models (TIEM) and an advocate for the Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM).

In Political Economy, I study bureaucracy and inequality, with a particular focus on China. My most recent work investigates the implicit influence of the affluent on political responsiveness in authoritarian regimes.
