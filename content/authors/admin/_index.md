Hi~ I am a Ph.D. candidate in Politics at NYU. I am interested in a variety of topics in social science. In Methodology, I primarily study causal mechanisms and moderation. I am working on how to use a simple identification strategy to simultaneously estimate treatment and mediated effects. In formal theory, I am particularly interested in information and communication. The current project is on full revelation in the deliberation and debate.

As you expected, I am both a Theoretical Implications of Empirical Model (TIEM) guy and an Empirical Implication of Theoretical Model (EITM) guy. Substantively, I study bureaucracy and inequality, with a special focus on China.

You can reach me via email: [jf3739@nyu.edu](mailto:jf3739@nyu.edu).
